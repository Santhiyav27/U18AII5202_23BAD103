# Smart Campus Monitoring Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
The Smart Campus Monitoring Dashboard is an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize academic performance data. It helps institutions monitor attendance, academic scores, and grade distribution using key performance indicators (KPIs), filters, and drill-down features.

## Dataset Used
- **File Name:** 5.student_performance.csv  
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains student academic details such as attendance percentage, internal test marks, assignment marks, department, semester, subject, and final grades.

---

## Objectives
- To monitor student attendance and academic performance.  
- To visualize department-wise and semester-wise performance.  
- To enable interactive analysis using filters and drill-downs.  
- To enhance transparency and data-driven decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies
- Power BI Desktop  
- CSV Dataset  
- Power Query Editor  

---

## Features of the Dashboard
- KPI cards showing average attendance percentage and average academic score  
- Department and semester interactive slicers  
- Drill-down analysis from department to semester to subject  
- Grade distribution visualization using a pie chart  
- Automatic linking between all visuals

## Procedure Summary
1. Load the student performance CSV file into Power BI.  
2. Create a calculated column to compute total academic score.  
3. Design KPI cards for attendance and academic performance.  
4. Add slicers for department and semester filtering.  
5. Create drill-down bar charts for performance analysis.  
6. Visualize final grade distribution using a pie chart.  
7. Enable interactions to link all dashboard views.
